projectM "EyeTune" Universal Windows Platform Frontend App
==========================================================

This project is the official Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application published in the Microsoft Store. It brings
you the awesome projectM/Milkdrop visuals to any X86-based device supported by Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform,
e.g. Surface and some Windows Mobile devices.

Due to platform limitations, this app currently does not allow adding any user-specific presets. It is also constrained
to OpenGL ES rendering, as UWP apps can run on both desktop and mobile devices.

If you look for a classic desktop application, you might rather want to
use [the SDL2-based frontend](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/frontend-sdl).
